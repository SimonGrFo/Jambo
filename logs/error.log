Description:

Parameter 0 of method musicPlayerService in com.example.jambo.config.JamboConfig required a single bean, but 2 were found:
	- progressSlider: defined by method 'progressSlider' in com.example.jambo.config.JamboConfig
	- volumeSlider: defined by method 'volumeSlider' in com.example.jambo.config.JamboConfig

This may be due to missing parameter name information

Action:

Consider marking one of the beans as @Primary, updating the consumer to accept multiple beans, or using @Qualifier to identify the bean that should be consumed

Ensure that your compiler is configured to use the '-parameters' flag.
You may need to update both your build tool settings as well as your IDE.
